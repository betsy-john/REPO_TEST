Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will “commit” their changes to this central copy.

“Committing” a change simply means recording the change in the central system. Other programmers can then see this change. They can also pull down the change, and the version control tool will automatically update the contents of any files that were changed.

Most modern version control systems deal with “changesets,” which simply are a groups of changes (possibly to many files) that should be treated as a cohesive whole. For example: a change to a C header file and the corresponding .c file should always be kept together.


Centralized version control solves the problems described in the previous post on What is Version Control?. Programmers no longer have to keep many copies of files on their hard drives manually, because the version control tool can talk to the central copy and retrieve any version they need on the fly.


Some of the most common centralized version control systems you may have heard of or used are CVS, Subversion (or SVN) and Perforce.
